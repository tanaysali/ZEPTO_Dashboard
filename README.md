Zepto Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive sales dashboard built in Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance for Zepto, an online grocery delivery service.
The dashboard helps identify trends, top-selling products, outlet performance, and customer buying behavior, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## Problem Statement

Zepto’s sales data was stored in raw CSV format and scattered across multiple reports.
Managers faced the following challenges:

1) No centralized dashboard for sales performance tracking.
2) Difficulty identifying top-selling categories and underperforming outlets.
3) Lack of real-time insights for quick decision-making.
4) Manual reporting caused delays and inefficiency.

## Solution Approach

To address these challenges, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that:
1) Consolidates sales data into a single, visually rich interface.
2) Allows filtering by location, outlet size, and item type.
3) Displays key metrics like Total Sales, Average Sales, Item Counts, and Ratings.
4) Provides visual insights into category performance, outlet comparison, and sales trends over time.
